# Project Description


Four users have been created. You can find it in the Customer.java

You can add or remove users from Customer.java

In case many users are added, in order to optimize, it first finds username in the customerlist and gets other information accordingly. So the whole list doesn't loop over and over again.

Database is not used. For this reason, there is no exit input from the program so that information is not lost. If you want to reset it, you have to rerun the project.
## IDE
